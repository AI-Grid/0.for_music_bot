# Changelog

## [2025-08-30] - pg1_id Tracking and Review Process Improvements

### Fixed
- **pg1_id extraction issue**: Fixed the workflow failing when `pg1_id` was not properly extracted from database response
- **Unnecessary retries**: Removed hard failure when `pg1_id` is missing, preventing unnecessary song regeneration
- **Review process blocking**: Added fallback review strategy when `pg1_id` is unavailable
- **IndentationError**: Fixed incorrect indentation in try-except block for database save operation

### Changed
- **URL behavior documentation**: Added extensive comments explaining that Suno.com no longer redirects to song page after creation (stays at `/create`)
- **Database response handling**: Enhanced to check both 'pg1_id' and 'id' column names in response
- **Error handling**: Changed from blocking errors to warnings with graceful fallbacks
- **Wait time**: Increased from 60 to 90 seconds for Suno processing (per user configuration)

### Added
- **Comprehensive debugging logs**: Added detailed logging throughout the workflow for better troubleshooting
  - Database operation logs with full response structure
  - pg1_id tracking through each workflow step
  - Clear labeling of expected vs unexpected behaviors
- **Temporary ID generation**: System now generates temporary IDs when Suno song ID cannot be extracted from URL
- **Fallback review mechanism**: Songs without `pg1_id` now use simplified review with manual review recommendation
- **Debug output categories**: Structured logging with [DEBUG], [INFO], [WARNING], [ERROR], [DATABASE] prefixes

### Technical Details
- **Root cause**: Suno.com's UI behavior changed - no longer redirects to individual song page after creation
- **Impact**: Cannot extract song ID from URL, affecting database tracking and AI review process
- **Solution**: Implemented multi-layer fallback system to ensure workflow continues despite missing IDs

### Files Modified
