# Suno Automation - Docker Desktop Edition

## Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed (Windows/Mac/Linux)
  - Download from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
- Minimum 4GB RAM available for Docker
- 2GB+ disk space for images and data

## Quick Start

### Windows Users
1. **Install Docker Desktop** from the link above
2. **Start Docker Desktop** and wait for it to be ready
3. **Double-click** `start.bat`
4. **Edit .env files** if prompted (first time only)
5. **Access the app** at http://localhost:3000

### Mac/Linux Users
1. **Install Docker Desktop** from the link above
2. **Start Docker Desktop** and wait for it to be ready
3. **Make scripts executable** (first time only):
   ```bash
   chmod +x start.sh stop.sh
   ```
4. **Run** `./start.sh`
5. **Edit .env files** if prompted (first time only)
6. **Access the app** at http://localhost:3000

## Developer Build Workflow (Unified Tags)

Use the helper scripts in `scripts/` to build the current host architecture with
consistent tags. Docker automatically resolves the correct image for each
platform when everyone shares the `suno-frontend:latest` and `suno-backend:latest`
tags.

```bash
# macOS/Linux
./scripts/build-images.sh --tag latest
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
pwsh ./scripts/build-images.ps1 -Tag latest
```

- Build for a specific platform: `./scripts/build-images.sh --tag latest --platform linux/amd64`
- Fetch the Camoufox archive ahead of time: `./scripts/build-images.sh --fetch-camoufox`
- Use a pre-downloaded archive: `./scripts/build-images.sh --manual-camoufox`

### Publishing multi-platform images

Ready to share images? Provide your registry namespace and push both
architectures in one step:

```bash
./scripts/build-images.sh --registry your-namespace --tag latest --push
```

```powershell
pwsh ./scripts/build-images.ps1 -Registry your-namespace -Tag latest -Push
```

### Manual Camoufox bundle (arm64 fallback)

When GitHub downloads are blocked or you need an offline bundle, run:

```bash
./scripts/fetch-camoufox.sh
./scripts/build-images.sh --tag latest --manual-camoufox
```

```powershell
pwsh ./scripts/fetch-camoufox.ps1
pwsh ./scripts/build-images.ps1 -Tag latest -ManualCamoufox
```

The helper stores the archive in `backend/build/artifacts/camoufox/` so the
backend Dockerfile can copy it during the build.

## Recommended Local Development Loop

Compose reads defaults from the root `.env` file:

```ini
TAG=latest
CAMOUFOX_SOURCE=auto
# FRONTEND_IMAGE=your-namespace/suno-frontend:latest
# BACKEND_IMAGE=your-namespace/suno-backend:latest
```

Leave the file untouched for local builds. To override anything, create
`.env.local` (already ignored by Git), adjust the values, and run Compose with it:

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.local up --build -d
```

Running without overrides continues to rely on `.env` automatically:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
docker-compose logs -f
docker-compose down
```

Common overrides:

1. Set `CAMOUFOX_SOURCE=manual` inside `.env.local` to reuse a pre-downloaded archive.
2. Uncomment and populate `FRONTEND_IMAGE` / `BACKEND_IMAGE` to run images pulled from a registry (`docker-compose up -d` is enough once images are set).
3. Create `docker-compose.override.yml` (git-ignored) for machine-specific tweaks such as local bind mounts; Compose loads it automatically alongside the base file.

## Stopping the Application

### Windows
Double-click `stop.bat`

### Mac/Linux
Run `./stop.sh`

## Data Storage Locations
All your data is stored locally in these folders:
- **Downloaded MP3 files**: `./songs/` folder
- **Browser session data**: `./camoufox_session_data/` folder
- **Application logs**: `./logs/` folder

These folders are created automatically and persist even after stopping Docker.

## First Time Setup

### 1. Environment Variables
The first time you run the application, it will create `.env` files from templates. You need to edit:

**backend/.env** - Add your API keys:
- Supabase URL and Key
- Database credentials
- OpenAI/Gemini API keys (if using AI features)

**frontend/.env** - Usually no changes needed unless using custom ports

### 2. Browser Download
On first run, Camoufox browser will be downloaded automatically (one-time process, ~100MB).

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Desktop Not Running
**Error**: "Docker is not running"
**Solution**: Start Docker Desktop and wait for it to fully initialize before running start script

### Port Already in Use
**Error**: "Port 3000/8000 already in use"
**Solution**:
1. Stop any other applications using these ports, OR
2. Edit `docker-compose.yml` to use different ports

### Browser Doesn't Work on Linux
Run this command before starting:
```bash
xhost +local:docker
```

### Low Performance
1. Open Docker Desktop settings
2. Increase memory allocation to 4GB or more
3. Restart Docker Desktop

### Container Fails to Start
Check logs with:
```bash
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose logs frontend
```

## Advanced Commands

### View Real-time Logs
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Restart Services
```bash
docker-compose restart
```

### Update to Latest Version
```bash
git pull
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

### Clean Everything (Reset)
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker system prune -f
```
**Warning**: This removes all Docker data except your songs/logs folders

### Access Backend Shell
```bash
docker exec -it suno-backend /bin/bash
```

## Building from Source

If you make changes to the code, rebuild with:
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

## System Requirements

### Minimum
- OS: Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 20.04+
- RAM: 4GB
- Storage: 2GB free space
- CPU: Dual-core processor

### Recommended
- RAM: 8GB or more
- Storage: 10GB free space
- CPU: Quad-core processor

## Features

- **Automated browser operations** with Camoufox
- **MP3 download and storage** in local folders
- **Web interface** at http://localhost:3000
- **API access** at http://localhost:8000
- **OpenAI-style chat API** at http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions secured with API keys and optional Discord password
- **Persistent data** across restarts
- **No technical knowledge required** for basic usage

## Security Notes

- Application runs locally on your machine
- No data is sent to external servers (except API calls you configure)
- Keep your `.env` files secure (they contain your API keys)
- Downloaded files stay on your local machine

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review logs with `docker-compose logs`
3. Check project documentation in the main README

## Uninstallation

1. Stop the application (`stop.bat` or `./stop.sh`)
2. Remove containers: `docker-compose down -v`
3. Delete the application folder
4. Optionally, uninstall Docker Desktop
