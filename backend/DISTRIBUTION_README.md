# Suno Automation Backend - Distribution Guide

## Current Distribution Status
The backend has been successfully bundled into a standalone executable.

## Distribution Contents
Located in: `backend\dist\suno-automation-backend\`

- **suno-automation-backend.exe** - Main executable
- **_internal** folder - Contains all Python dependencies and data files
- **camoufox_session_data** folder - For browser session data

## Camoufox Browser Handling

### Current Approach (Lightweight Distribution)
The Camoufox browser binary is **NOT included** in the distribution to keep file size smaller.
- Browser will be downloaded automatically on first use
- Requires internet connection for initial setup
- Browser cached locally after first download

### For Complete Offline Distribution
If you need a fully offline-ready distribution:

1. The Camoufox browser binaries are managed by the Python package
2. When the application runs, it will automatically download the browser on first use
3. The browser is cached in user's AppData folder

## How to Distribute

1. **Copy the entire folder**: `backend\dist\suno-automation-backend\`
2. **Users run**: `suno-automation-backend.exe`
3. **Server starts on**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

## Requirements for End Users
- Windows 10 or higher
- Internet connection (first run only, for browser download)
- No Python installation required
- No additional dependencies needed

## File Size
- Current distribution: ~60MB (without browser)
- With browser included: ~150MB (approximate)

## Testing the Distribution
1. Copy the dist folder to a different location
2. Run `suno-automation-backend.exe`
3. Check that server starts on port 8000
4. Browser will download on first actual use

## Notes
