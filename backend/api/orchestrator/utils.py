    üéº CORE ORCHESTRATOR WORKFLOW
    
    Executes the complete song generation and review process with intelligent retry logic.
    
    WORKFLOW STEPS:
    1. Generate 2 songs on Suno.com (single generation creates 2 variants)
    2. Wait for Suno processing
    3. Download both songs using negative indexing (-1, -2)
    4. AI review each song for quality
    5. Handle verdicts:
       - "continue": Move to backend/songs/final_review  
       - "re-roll": Delete and retry generation
    6. Auto-retry up to 3 times if needed
    7. Fallback: Move final attempt songs to final_review regardless
    
    Args:
        book_name (str): Bible book name
        chapter (int): Chapter number  
        verse_range (str): Verse range (e.g., "1-5")

        title (str): Song title
        song_structure_id (int, optional): Song structure ID for review

Original song structure: {song_structure}

Actual lyrics used in generation:
{pg1_lyrics}

We are looking for things that don't match which indicates the song must be deleted and remade. Our goal is to go verse by verse and stay perfectly in order without skipping or adjusting or repeating. If the song has adlibs near the start, this is acceptable. If the song repeats a single sentence or a few words directly after that sentence or phrase has been said, this is an acceptable creative decision. If the song fully completes the lyrics, any repetition that comes after is acceptable as long as the lyrics were completely sung through at least once fully in order. Since some words may not have been recognized by you, if you notice that a word is spelled differently, but with similar phonetics, assume that the word is correct and you just misheard before. Please tell me if the song needs to be deleted and remade, or if it is safe to keep.
